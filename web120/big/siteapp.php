            <p>Responsive Website vs. Native Mobile App? This is a question new and existing businesses ask frequently. They both have their merits, and we will explore both, and determine which to recommend over the other.</p>

            <p>Now, adapting web content through responsive design has two key advantages: time and money. Generally speaking, developing a responsive site is much quicker and allows the Client to get their site up as quickly as possible. Responsive sites are just one development process that allows the site to be viewed on most modern mobile browsers (Murillo). It doesn’t require the development team to adhere to any OS guidelines or permissions (Murillo).</p>

            <p>Of course, there are a couple of drawbacks. They require an internet connection, which in some situations can leave site users looking for alternative options depending on the circumstances. They have poor performance. Each time the user interacts with the site, they have to load the entire page, over and over again. This can lead to larger a consumption of data and battery life. Responsive sites lack push notifications, and other technologies like voice recognition, AR and QR code readers.</p>
            
            <p><img class="desktop siteapp" src="images/mobile.jpg" alt="mobile"><img class="phone siteappph" src="images/mobileph.jpg" alt="mobile">That leads us to Native Mobile Apps. Now, the pros here are pretty much the exact opposites of the cons of the Responsive apps. Internet connections isn’t always needed. They tend to have better performance because all the elements of the app are installed on the device at the time of the download. You are able to use additional technologies like QR readers, push notifications, etc. They allow users to personalize their experience more, and offer better brand awareness.</p>

            <p>As you guessed it, the two major drawbacks of Native Mobile Apps are time and money. Building an app requires a different set of skills and, if done incorrectly, can make your company appear ametuer. This can hurt your Brand Awareness. Because of this, many companies pay top dollar for native apps (Kris).</p>

            <p>So, which one should you choose? In my opinion, if you’re starting out, go with a Responsive Website. This will allow you to get your site out there and will allow you to reach a wider audience. After you have built your company, and have a little more capital to work with, then go after a Native Mobile App. However, KEEP BOTH UP TO DATE! Do not let your website, fall behind because you have an app, AND don’t let your app fall behind, and become out of date because you think  version 1 is the best.</p>
