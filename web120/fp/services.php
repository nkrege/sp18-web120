                    <h2>Chiropractic Adjustments</h2>
                    <p>Whether you've been in an auto accident, or you just experience the small bumps of everyday life, chiropractic can help get you functioning properly again.  The spine, when prevented from moving properly, can manifest as all sorts of problems throughout the body - not just neck pain and back pain.  The chiropractic adjustment helps restore motion in the spine and help your body get back to the optimal function.</p>

                    <h2>Modalities</h2>
                    <p>We offer additional therapies that work in tandem with the chiropractic adjustment.  While the adjustment is often all that you need, sometimes a bigger injury can benefit from additional treatments like electrical stimulation, ultrasound, laser, massage, or spinal decompression.</p>
